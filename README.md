🚨 **Accident Severity Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on predicting the severity of various types of accidents using machine learning techniques. Developed as part of a final academic assignment, it showcases the full data analysis pipeline including cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

📝 **Project Summary**

Accidents—whether on roads, in workplaces, or public areas—have wide-ranging impacts on human safety and economic stability. Accurately predicting the severity of accidents can help optimize emergency response, prioritize resource allocation, and drive preventive measures.

This project leverages a real-world dataset with multiple accident contexts and applies machine learning models to classify the severity of each incident based on attributes like time, location, environment, and involved parties.

📌 **Key Highlights**

- ✅ Analyzed multi-context accident dataset with 20+ relevant features  
- 🧹 Cleaned and preprocessed data (null handling, data type fixes, encoding)  
- 📊 Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to reveal influential variables  
- 🧠 Built and evaluated classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- 📈 Visualized key relationships using charts, heatmaps, and confusion matrices  
- 📌 Concluded with insights and future improvement directions
